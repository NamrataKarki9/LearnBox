business. Both classification and clusteringcan be used in different contexts: •Classification: •to predict whether a customer will purchasea product or not based on previous data (e.g., their browsing history,

KNN example 42 Evaluation Metrics 43 End of Lecture 2 Semi-Supervised Learning •uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. •Combines aspects of both supervised and unsupervised learning. •Useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming, but abundant unlabeled data is available. •The algorithm tries to learn from the labeled data and generalizes this learning to the unlabeled data. •Common Algorithms: •Self-training: Uses labeled data to train a model, then applies the model to the unlabeled data, iteratively adding the most confident predictions

The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penaltiesand adjusts its actions to maximize cumulative rewards. •No labeled data, but feedbackis provided after each action. •The agent explores

•Cross Validation: try a range of k values, and for each, compute the model's performance on different folds of the data. The goal is to find the value of k that gives the lowest error or highest accuracy on the validation set. •Elbow Method: You can plot the error rate (or accuracy) against different values of k. As you increase k, the error rate typically decreases initially but then flattens out or starts to increase slightly. The \"elbow\" point in this curve is often considered the optimal value of k, where the error rate is low, but increasing k further doesn't provide significant gains. 52 1 Data is everywhere! 2 The

false negatives, which helps understand where the model is making correct or incorrect predictions. •Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the

Role of Neuron •adds up the value of every neurons from the previous column it is connected to •3 inputs (x1, x2, x3) coming to the neuron, so 3 neurons of the previous column are connected to our neuron. •value is multiplied, before being added, by another variable called “weight” (w1, w2, w3) which determines the connection between the two neurons. •Each connection of neurons has its own weight, and those are the only values that will be modified during the learning

Disadvantages: •Vanishing Gradient Problem:For very large or very small inputs, the gradient becomes close to 0, slowing down learning. •Computationally Expensive:Involves exponential calculations. •Think of a dimmer switch for a light bulb that gradually increases brightness from 0 (off) to 1 (fully on) as you turn it. 1 Tools, package, frameworks 2 Neural Networks 3 Milestones and applications

pass 1 ) 22 First cycle of backpropagation, 23 Epoch increase (forward+backward propagation cycle ). Tanh Advantages: •Zero-Centered Output:Helps in faster convergence during optimization as the mean of activations is closer to 0. •Smooth Gradient:Like sigmoid, it provides a smooth transition. Disadvantages: •Vanishing Gradient Problem:Similar to sigmoid, it suffers from small gradients for very

(forward+backward propagation cycle ). When to Use Each Activation Function •ReLU: •Preferred for hidden layers in deep networks. •Works well for most tasks unless dead neurons become an issue. •Sigmoid: •Suitable for the output layer in binary classification problems. •Rarely used in hidden layers due to vanishing gradient issues. •Tanh: •Useful for hidden layers where data is zero-centered. •Provides better gradients than sigmoid but still suffers from vanishing gradients. 1 Tools, package, frameworks 2 Neural Networks 3 Milestones and applications 4 Role of Neuron 5 Components of a Neural Network 6 Activation functions 7 ReLU

Dead Neuron •A dead neuronis a neuron in a neural network that stops updating its weights during training because its output is always zero. •This happens primarily in activation functions like ReLU(Rectified Linear Unit) when the input to the neuron is consistently negative. •How Do Dead Neurons Occur? •The ReLUactivation function is defined as: •If a neuron's input becomes negative, its output is 0. •During backpropagation, the gradient of ReLUfor x≤0 is also 0. •As a result, the weights

Implementation Imagine you're at a coffee shop deciding what to order: •Input:Weather, your mood, and time of day. •Weights:Adjust the importance of each factor (e.g., mood might matter more than weather). •Hidden Layers:Combine these factors to decide between hot or cold drinks. •Output:Your final order (e.g., iced coffee). 1 Tools, package, frameworks 2 Neural Networks 3 Milestones and

base ●Cannot test from the user’s perspective White Box Testing -Steps ●Design all test scenarios, test cases and prioritize them according to high priority number. ●This step involves the study of code at runtime to examine the resource utilization, not accessed areas of the code, time taken by various methods and operations and so on. ●In this step testing of internal subroutines takes place. Internal subroutines such as nonpublic methods, interfaces are able to handle all types of data appropriately or not. White Box Testing -Steps ●This step focuses on testing of control statements like loops

White Box Testing -Steps ●This step focuses on testing of control statements like loops and conditional statements to check the efficiency and accuracy for different data inputs. ●In the last step white box testing includes security testing to check all possible security loopholes by looking at how the code handles security. White Box Testing -Types ●Unit Testing ○tests written as part of the application code, which test that each component is working as expected ●Mutation Testing ○checks the robustness and consistency of

White Box Testing -Focus ●Expected output ○executing all possible inputs to a function to see if it always returns the expected output ●Loop testing ○checking single loops, concatenated loops and nested loops for efficiency, conditional logic and correct handling of local and global variables ●Data Flow testing ○tracking variables and their values as they pass through the code to find variables that are not correctly initialized, declared but never used, or incorrectly manipulated Testing Techniques and Code Coverage ●White Box Testing Goal -cover the source code as comprehensively as possible ●Metric that shows how much of an application’s code has unit tests checking its functionality Testing Techniques and Code Coverage ●Within code coverage, it is possible to verify how much

range of inputs, to ensure all lines of code are actually executed Statement Coverage ●Helps uncover unused statements, unused branches, missing statements that are reference by part of the code, and dead code left over from previous versions Ensure statements in the code are run and tested at least once Branch Coverage ●Maps the code into branches of conditional logic, and ensures that each and every branch is covered by unit tests ●Tester identifies all conditional and unconditional branches and writes code to execute as many branches as possible Branch Coverage ●A, C, and D are conditional"},"vector":[0.008191808126866817,0.02775835432112217,-0.03724377229809761,-0.017668776214122772,0.012569141574203968,-0.006721127778291702,-0.034555789083242416,0.03455590829253197,-0.004019534215331078,0.04541816562414169,0.010278779082000256,-0.009040930308401585,0.08732209354639053,-0.04504287242889404,0.04840924218297005,-0.024331185966730118,-0.00848331581801176,-0.020273560658097267,-0.03255756199359894,-0.050985973328351974,-0.00846881978213787,-0.016492219641804695,-0.06525876373052597,0.050475336611270905,-0.06281369179487228,-0.04680066183209419,-0.0181125495582819,-0.05542110651731491,0.035850390791893005,0.009340639226138592,-0.02276959829032421,0.07062824070453644,0.03760167956352234,0.08319602161645889,0.03489723056554794,-0.046865858137607574,0.04563182592391968,-0.020035244524478912,-0.05969898775219917,0.037551213055849075,-0.10080909729003906,-0.05273103341460228,-0.023629311472177505,0.022969286888837814,0.03498600423336029,-0.015493818558752537,-0.06837579607963562,-0.00384187581948936,-0.09085458517074585,-0.012880571186542511,0.014711790718138218,-0.00009249364666175097,-0.0050598690286278725,0.009275289252400398,0.009859844110906124,-0.07176622003316879,0.013567551970481873,-0.06343872845172882,-0.022550079971551895,0.022026218473911285,-0.013423376716673374,-0.009186483919620514,-0.046562906354665756,0.020856231451034546,0.07195620983839035,-0.00591216329485178,-0.01783706620335579,0.06756114214658737,0.0977117270231247,-0.04545248672366142,-0.049887269735336304,-0.006890431512147188,-0.007865998893976212,0.0362556017935276,0.027600949630141258,0.07209964096546173,0.05104154348373413,-0.020261699333786964,0.008985521271824837,-0.12115144729614258,-0.07737105339765549,-0.003151907352730632,0.006764816585928202,0.04699471965432167,-0.011147583834826946,0.06938555836677551,0.08388461172580719,-0.04886316880583763,0.053212303668260574,0.02466476522386074,0.06307017058134079,-0.017224889248609543,-0.008365216664969921,-0.0000370114175893832,0.07357454299926758,-0.019381701946258545,-0.008277194574475288,-0.04746237397193909,0.0538516528904438,0.06498934328556061,0.041879504919052124,-0.06868463009595871,0.0865645483136177,-0.07346373051404953,-0.017848046496510506,-0.0567413829267025,0.08094696700572968,-0.07308610528707504,0.015948602929711342,-0.09642357379198074,0.030861977487802505,-0.03419940918684006,0.04870275408029556,-0.037964679300785065,-0.013939173892140388,-0.057733748108148575,0.012775268405675888,0.033829495310783386,-0.048825278878211975,0.05525371432304382,0.006314172875136137,0.05551823601126671,0.03172780200839043,-0.007439119275659323,0.07901492714881897,0.009801626205444336,0.028835522010922432,1.2507655152724603e-32,-0.018713058903813362,-0.07449094951152802,-0.05335716903209686,0.0829751268029213,-0.035115525126457214,-0.00855995249003172,0.028475692495703697,0.04049309715628624,0.018902283161878586,0.10884005576372147,0.0008169868960976601,0.004034038167446852,-0.012425997294485569,0.04034293442964554,0.006997861433774233,0.031044920906424522,-0.06831809878349304,0.01918072998523712,-0.03754901885986328,0.055729057639837265,-0.005582463461905718,-0.06182456389069557,-0.021898385137319565,-0.033326707780361176,-0.018546683713793755,0.029308905825018883,0.02183215320110321,0.024055873975157738,-0.018497377634048462,0.045654911547899246,0.049895383417606354,0.020270053297281265,-0.08059375733137131,0.13019943237304688,-0.04386360943317413,0.0934615284204483,-0.010877776890993118,-0.03338862210512161,0.02796744555234909,0.020416568964719772,-0.06473612040281296,-0.08291575312614441,0.019379055127501488,0.021539833396673203,0.07624990493059158,-0.08751174807548523,-0.13017190992832184,-0.02432193234562874,0.018881414085626602,-0.02379230596125126,0.06532753258943558,0.09534238278865814,0.00034456365392543375,-0.036139748990535736,-0.008222532458603382,0.01050051674246788,-0.01044530887156725,-0.0278762299567461,-0.013415634632110596,0.14559480547904968,-0.04977893829345703,-0.05182616785168648,-0.120380699634552,0.016501041129231453,-0.05001986771821976,0.023667315021157265,-0.07590025663375854,-0.14313840866088867,0.034947436302900314,-0.01690622791647911,-0.07682976871728897,-0.04597940668463707,0.03388751670718193,0.02491913177073002,-0.01709466427564621,-0.06318877637386322,0.03944622725248337,0.05197623744606972,-0.029234889894723892,-0.0366852842271328,-0.0019064564257860184,0.02163207344710827,-0.07570917904376984,-0.011108607053756714,0.0012903447495773435,0.002186019206419587,0.01800106093287468,-0.05259336903691292,-0.07384935766458511,-0.0960930660367012,0.05313827469944954,-0.009583246894180775,0.039047930389642715,0.009946048259735107,0.14522822201251984,-1.387845201246426e-32,0.017770612612366676,0.08922703564167023,-0.04656142741441727,0.027987705543637276,-0.06687311083078384,-0.02900388278067112,0.043834928423166275,-0.06572432070970535,-0.045368701219558716,-0.049678560346364975,-0.029406404122710228,0.0017807045951485634,0.0016550485743209

This determines the minimum number of inputs you need to test all ways to execute the program. •A software metricthat provides a quantitative measureof the logical/structural complexity of a program in terms of linearly independent paths . The cyc lomatic com plexity of a me thod also denote s the num ber of unit test c ases required to ac hieve the 100 % c ode c overage for that method. Cyclomatic Complexity, V(G) This is defined in 1 of 3 ways 1.The number of regions in the flow graph corresponds to the cyclomatic complexity 2. Cyclomatic complexity, V(G), for a flow graph G is also defined as V(G) = E –N + 2 where E is the number of flow

number of regions in the flow graph corresponds to the cyclomatic complexity 2. Cyclomatic complexity, V(G), for a flow graph G is also defined as V(G) = E –N + 2 where E is the number of flow graph edges and N is the number of flow graph nodes. 3. Cyclomatic complexity, V (G), is also defined for a flow graph G as V(G) = P + 1 where P is the number of predicate nodes contained in the flow graph G Each node that contains a condition is called a predicate node and is characterized by two or more edges emanating from it.

improve the accuracy of predictions. •-approach of combining multiple ML models Ensemble methods in ML -Bagging -Boosting -Stacking Ensemble in Supervised, Unsupervised, Hybrid Bagging(e.g., Random Forest): Combines predictions from multiple decision trees trained on random subsets of data. Boosting(e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting): Sequentially trains models to correct errors of the previous ones. Stacking: Combines predictions from several models using a meta-model. In Supervised ensemble techniques are less common but still applicable in unsupervised Cluster Ensembles: Combine results from multiple

Result: The decision is more accurate because it considers diverse perspectives (trees), reducing the risk of errors. 1 Let's Ensemble 2 Ensemble Contd.. 3 Ensemble in Supervised, Unsupervised, Hybrid

motivation: •Why not just continue with the Decision Tree? •How random forest improve on decision tree? •Random Decision Forests paper by Tin Kam 1995 in conference on Document Analysis and Recognition •Create subsets of randomly picked features at each potential split i.efirst proposed: “Random decision forests” (1995) was then extended by LeoBreimanand published in “RandomForests” article in 2001. •Decision tree is restricted by the GINI IMPURITY •No guarantee of using all features •Root node will always be the same •Root feature has huge influence over the tree •Could try

to use? 25 Conclusion Bootstrapis a sampling technique where you create new datasets by random sampling with replacementfrom the original dataset. •Original dataset size = N •Bootstrap sample size = N •Sampling is with replacement •Some records repeat, some are left out It is mainly used in baggingand Random Forest. Create multiple different training datasets Reduce variance Improve model stability •Bootstrap the selection of rows for each split •Subset of features used •Bootstrapped rows of data •Bootstrapping is meant to reduce correlation between trees 1 Let's Ensemble 2 Ensemble

(for classification). •Reduces overfitting by averaging predictions. •Works well with high-variance models like decision trees. •Models are trained in parallel, making it computationally efficient. 1
